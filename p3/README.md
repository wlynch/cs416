For RPC we should use protobuf-c so it will generate all of the data structures, helper methods
and the like for us. Downloads are available [here](https://code.google.com/p/protobuf-c/downloads/list).

For OS X users with brew, brew install protobuf-c. It is a little out dated but it's stable, I think.
